<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    My data was from the month of November to the month of March, the graph
    showed growth in the month of December but it turned out in the month of
    January and in the end it increased a little in the months of February and
    March.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
      There was only a near relation in the months of November, February and March since the red and gray dots were very 
      close to each other but in the months of December and January the red 
      dots were very separated from the gray ones.

    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    In the next month, i consume 150 KWH
  </p>
    <li>
      A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
      remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
    </li>
    <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    In conclusion, in my house we must reduce energy consumption because it can
    decrease much more. It can be reduced by always turning off the lights and
    turning them on only when necessary. Apart from that, turn on the television
    if it is seriously going to be used and thus the energy cost will be more
    stable.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
      In the graph of the people surveyed, it was evidenced that many have almost the same energy expenditure except 2 that are very different from the others, one of them spent more than 475 kWh of energy.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
      It was evidenced that the red dots and the gray dots are very close but cannot touch each other.
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
      Will be consumed 18.028,81 kwh
  </p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
      In conclusion, some data were very similar to each other except for one that was very far from all. Most were in the range of 140 to 240 and the farthest to 475 kWh.
      Most people have a very high cost to be very few people living in the house, they can reduce energy consumption much more.
  </p>
</ul>
