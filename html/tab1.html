<h3>Electric energy</h3>
<p>
  Electrical energy is the energy derived from electric potential energy or
  kinetic energy of the charged particles. In general, it is referred to as the
  energy that has been converted from electric potential energy. We can define
  electrical energy as the energy generated by the movement of electrons from
  one point to another. The movement of charged particles along/through a medium
  (say wire) constitute current or electricity.
  <h4>Formule of electric energy</h4>
  <p>
      A cell has two terminals – a negative and a positive terminal. The negative terminal has the excess of electrons whereas the positive terminal has a deficiency of electrons. Let us take the positive terminal as A and the electrical potential at A is given by V(A). Similarly, the negative terminal is B and the electrical potential at B is given by V(B). Electric current flows from A to B, and thus V(A) > V (B).
  
      <p>
      The potential difference between A and B is given by: <br>

      V = V(A) – V(B) > 0 <br>
      <br>
Mathematically, electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge through the cross-section of a conductor. <br>
Thus, it is given by: <br>
I = ∆Q/ ∆t, where I is the electric current and ∆Q is the quantity of electric charge flowing through a point in time ∆t. <br>
The potential energy of charge Q at A is Q V(A) and at B, it is Q V(B). So the change in the potential energy is given by: <br>
<br>
∆Upot = Final potential energy – Initial potential energy
  <br>
= ∆Q [(V (B) – V (A)] = –∆Q V <br>
<br>
= –I V∆t (Since I = ∆Q/ ∆t) <br>
<br>
If we take the kinetic energy of the system into account, it would also change if the charges inside the conductor moved without collision. This is to keep the total energy of the system unchanged. Thus, by conservation of total energy, we have: <br>
<br>
∆K = –∆Upot <br>
<br>
Or ∆K = I V∆t > 0 <br>
<br>
Thus, in the electric field, if the charges move freely across the conductor, there would be an increase in the kinetic energy as they move. <br>
<br>
When the charges collide, the energy gained by them is shared between the atoms. Consequently, the vibration of the atoms increases resulting in the heating up of the conductor. Thus, some amount of energy is dissipated in the form of heat in an actual conductor. <br>
<h4>Units of electric energy</h4>
<p>
    The basic unit of electrical energy is the joule or watt-second. An electrical energy is said to be one joule when one ampere of current flows through the circuit for a second when the potential difference of one volt is applied across it. The commercial unit of electrical energy is the kilowatt-hour (kWh) which is also knwon as the Board of trade unit (B.O.T). <br>
    <br>
    1 kwh = 1000 × 60 × 60 watt – second <br>
    1 kwh = 36 × 105 Ws or Joules <br>
    Generally, one kwh is called one unit.
</p>
<h4>Examples of electric energy</h4>
      <p>
          A few examples of electrical energy are: <br>
          <br>

          -In a car battery, a chemical reaction results in the formation of an electron which possesses the energy to move in an electric current. These moving charges provide electrical energy to the circuits in the car. <br>
          -Lightning, during a thunderstorm, is an example of electrical energy – what we see as lightning is nothing but electricity discharging in the atmosphere. <br>
          -Electric eels generate electrical energy and use it against predators for defence. <br>

  <h3>Watt (Physical Unit)</h3>
  <p>
      The watt (abbreviated W) is the International System of Units' (SI) standard unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second. The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy isdissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or dissipated.<br>
      <br>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
      It is summarized in the following formula: P=V.I. Where V represents voltage in watts, I represents current in amperes and P represents power in watts.It is summarized in the following formula: P=V.I. Where V represents voltage in watts, I represents current in amperes and P represents power in watts. <br>
      <br>
      When an object's velocity is held constant at one meter per second against a constant opposing force of one newton, the rate at which work is done is one watt. <br>
1W=1J/s=1N⋅m/s=1kg⋅m2⋅s−3<br>
<br>
In terms of electromagnetism, one watt is the rate at which electrical work is performed when a current of one ampere (A) flows across an electrical potential difference of one volt (V), meaning the watt is equivalent to the volt-ampere (the latter unit, however, is used for a different quantity from the real power of an electrical circuit). <br>
<br>
1W=1V×1A <br>
<br>
Two additional unit conversions for watt can be found using the above equation and Ohm's law. <br>
<br>
1W=1V2/Ω=1A2⋅Ω <br>
<br>
where ohm (Ω\Omega ) is the SI derived unit of electrical resistance. <br>
      </p>
<h4>Examples of watt</h4>
  <p>
      -A person with a mass of 100 kg climbing a staircase 3 meters high in 5 seconds does about 600 watts of work. The mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity multiplied by the height and divided by the time it takes to lift the object to the given height gives the work rate or power. <br>
      -Over the course of an eight-hour day, a worker can maintain an average power output of about 75 watts; athletes can achieve higher power levels during short intervals. <br>
