<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    in the since from December to February, in my house, we managed to decrease
    exponentially, however, in March we increased in a big way, because we
    implemented electric energy in the house, leaving gas aside, but in April,
    we learned to manage this resource a little better, which made us decrease
    much more.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    The red dots refer to the consumption that we have had throughout the
    months, the gray dots are a linear regression diagram that helps us to make
    an approximation and relationship between the consumption of the different
    variables, in my case, can be seen, as it is decreasing
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    In my house, I would expect to use 272kwh.
  </p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    In my case, generates a decression is something a little difficult, because
    the most things are handled with electricity, as for example: the stove, the
    water heater, the doors and everything that has to do with intelligence, but
    could be kept one of the prices more cheap, this could be given by: don´t
    leave the devices connected to the light, don´t leave the lights switched on
    when not in use, switch off the electric devices when not in use and in some
    way or another shower fast, for the heater not to use too much energy

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    Regarding the energy use of my classmates, we can see that the regression is
    growing, and it also tells us that the more people live in a house, the more
    energy will be spent.
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    the red dots indicate each partner, as well as the dependent variables:
    number of people living in the house and amount of energy spent in kwh, the
    gray dots are the regression diagram. These 2 show us that: the more people
    in a house, the higher the energy expenditure, so it creates a growth of
    going from 88 to 728 kWh.
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    Will be consumed 21694.18kwh
  </p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <h5>Answer</h5>
  <p>
    In conclusion we can see how some people use much more energy than others,
    but this also varies: from the people who live in the house and the amount
    of electronic devices that they have, at the same time, a solution for us to
    learn to economize is to use LED devices, which do not spend much energy and
    in turn, only use these electronic devices when it is only and exclusively
    necessary.
