    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.
    </p>
    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
            <h5>Answer</h5>
            <p>
                In my data from December 2022 to April 2023, a decrease was evidenced.
            </p>
            <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
            <h5>Answer</h5>
            <p>
                The red dots do not have a logical order with respect to the regression line, which is an approximation to the energy actually spent.
            </p>
            <li>Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
            <h5>Answer</h5>
            <p>
              For the next month the consumption will be 179.4. The result was obtained with the formula y: -1,00x + 185,40
            </p>
            <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</li>
            <h5>Answer</h5>
            <p>
                To conclude we must take into account that the graph has shown a large energy consumption for so few people living in a house, so we must look for solutions such as:
                Taking advantage of sunlight during the day, turning off lights when they are not being used or disconnecting appliances that are not being used, among others.
            </p>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
         <h5>Answer</h5>
            <p>
                After having carried out a survey of 10 different people, the linear regression graph shows an increase in consumption.
            </p>
         <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
         <h5>Answer</h5>
            <p>
                The red dots which tell us the true consumption are not in a logical order and do not follow the linear regression line.
            </p>
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
         <h5>Answer</h5>
            <p>
                In a residential unit 8782.49kwh would be consumed if there were 200 people.
            </p>
         <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li>
         <h5>Answer</h5>
            <p>
                In conclusion we can see that there are people who do not spend much light, but there are also others who spend a lot and it is better to economize and if possible seek solutions such as not connecting several appliances in the same place or use energy saving bulbs that spend 75% less and thus reduce the use of light to take care of our planet.
            </p>
      </ul>
