<h3>Electric energy</h3>
<p>
  Electrical energy is the energy derived from electric potential energy or
  kinetic energy of the charged particles. In general, it is referred to as the
  energy that has been converted from electric potential energy. We can define
  electrical energy as the energy generated by the movement of electrons from
  one point to another. The movement of charged particles along/through a medium
  (say wire) constitute current or electricity.

  <h4>Formule of electric energy</h4>
  <p>
      A cell has two terminals – a negative and a positive terminal. The negative terminal has the excess of electrons whereas the positive terminal has a deficiency of electrons. Let us take the positive terminal as A and the electrical potential at A is given by V(A). Similarly, the negative terminal is B and the electrical potential at B is given by V(B). Electric current flows from A to B, and thus V(A) > V (B).
  
      <p>
      The potential difference between A and B is given by: <br>

      V = V(A) – V(B) > 0 <br>
      <br>
Mathematically, electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge through the cross-section of a conductor. <br>
Thus, it is given by: <br>
I = ∆Q/ ∆t, where I is the electric current and ∆Q is the quantity of electric charge flowing through a point in time ∆t. <br>
The potential energy of charge Q at A is Q V(A) and at B, it is Q V(B). So the change in the potential energy is given by: <br>
<br>
∆Upot = Final potential energy – Initial potential energy
  <br>
= ∆Q [(V (B) – V (A)] = –∆Q V <br>
<br>
= –I V∆t (Since I = ∆Q/ ∆t) <br>
<br>
If we take the kinetic energy of the system into account, it would also change if the charges inside the conductor moved without collision. This is to keep the total energy of the system unchanged. Thus, by conservation of total energy, we have: <br>
<br>
∆K = –∆Upot <br>
<br>
Or ∆K = I V∆t > 0 <br>
<br>
Thus, in the electric field, if the charges move freely across the conductor, there would be an increase in the kinetic energy as they move. <br>
<br>
When the charges collide, the energy gained by them is shared between the atoms. Consequently, the vibration of the atoms increases resulting in the heating up of the conductor. Thus, some amount of energy is dissipated in the form of heat in an actual conductor. <br>
<h4>Units of electric energy</h4>
<p>
    The basic unit of electrical energy is the joule or watt-second. An electrical energy is said to be one joule when one ampere of current flows through the circuit for a second when the potential difference of one volt is applied across it. The commercial unit of electrical energy is the kilowatt-hour (kWh) which is also knwon as the Board of trade unit (B.O.T). <br>
    <br>
    1 kwh = 1000 × 60 × 60 watt – second <br>
    1 kwh = 36 × 105 Ws or Joules <br>
    Generally, one kwh is called one unit.

<h4>Examples of electric energy</h4>
      <p>
          A few examples of electrical energy are: <br>
          <br>

          -In a car battery, a chemical reaction results in the formation of an electron which possesses the energy to move in an electric current. These moving charges provide electrical energy to the circuits in the car. <br>
          -Lightning, during a thunderstorm, is an example of electrical energy – what we see as lightning is nothing but electricity discharging in the atmosphere. <br>
          -Electric eels generate electrical energy and use it against predators for defence. <br>

  <h3>Watt (Physical Unit)</h3>
  <p>
      The watt (abbreviated W) is the International System of Units' (SI) standard unit of power (energy per unit time), the equivalent of one jouleper second. The watt is used to specify the rate at which electrical energy isdissipated, or the rate at which electromagnetic energy is radiated, absorbed, or dissipated.<br>
      <br>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
      It is summarized in the following formula: P=V.I. Where V represents voltage in watts, I represents current in amperes and P represents power in watts.It is summarized in the following formula: P=V.I. Where V represents voltage in watts, I represents current in amperes and P represents power in watts. <br>
      <br>
      When an object's velocity is held constant at one meter per second against a constant opposing force of one newton, the rate at which work is done is one watt. <br>
1W=1J/s=1N⋅m/s=1kg⋅m2⋅s−3<br>
<br>
In terms of electromagnetism, one watt is the rate at which electrical work is performed when a current of one ampere (A) flows across an electrical potential difference of one volt (V), meaning the watt is equivalent to the volt-ampere (the latter unit, however, is used for a different quantity from the real power of an electrical circuit). <br>
<br>
1W=1V×1A <br>
<br>
Two additional unit conversions for watt can be found using the above equation and Ohm's law. <br>
<br>
1W=1V2/Ω=1A2⋅Ω <br>
<br>
where ohm (Ω\Omega ) is the SI derived unit of electrical resistance. <br>
      </p>
<h4>Examples of watt</h4>
  <p>
      -A person with a mass of 100 kg climbing a staircase 3 meters high in 5 seconds does about 600 watts of work. The mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity multiplied by the height and divided by the time it takes to lift the object to the given height gives the work rate or power. <br>
      -Over the course of an eight-hour day, a worker can maintain an average power output of about 75 watts; athletes can achieve higher power levels during short intervals. <br>

  <h3>Scatter plot </h3>
<p>
    A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.
</p>

<br>
<h4>When you should use a scatter plor?</h4>
  <p>
      Scatter plots’ primary uses are to observe and show relationships between two numeric variables. The dots in a scatter plot not only report the values of individual data points, but also patterns when the data are taken as a whole. <br>
      <br>
      Identification of correlational relationships are common with scatter plots. In these cases, we want to know, if we were given a particular horizontal value, what a good prediction would be for the vertical value. You will often see the variable on the horizontal axis denoted an independent variable, and the variable on the vertical axis the dependent variable. Relationships between variables can be described in many ways: positive or negative, strong or weak, linear or nonlinear.
      <img src="imagenes/2.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /> <br>
      <br>
      A scatter plot can also be useful for identifying other patterns in data. We can divide data points into groups based on how closely sets of points cluster together. Scatter plots can also show if there are any unexpected gaps in the data and if there are any outlier points. This can be useful if we want to segment the data into different parts, like in the development of user persons. <br>

  </p>
  <h3>What is linear regression?</h3>
  <p>
      Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable. <br>
      <br>
      This form of analysis estimates the coefficients of the linear equation, involving one or more independent variables that best predict the value of the dependent variable. Linear regression fits a straight line or surface that minimizes the discrepancies between predicted and actual output values. There are simple linear regression calculators that use a “least squares” method to discover the best-fit line for a set of paired data. You then estimate the value of X (dependent variable) from Y (independent variable). <br>
      <br>

  </p>
      <h4>Why linear regression is important?</h4> 
    <p>
    Linear-regression models are relatively simple and provide an easy-to-interpret mathematical formula that can generate predictions. Linear regression can be applied to various areas in business and academic study. <br>
    You’ll find that linear regression is used in everything from biological, behavioral, environmental and social sciences to business. Linear-regression models have become a proven way to scientifically and reliably predict the future <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <h4>Examples</h4>
  <p>
       Can also use linear-regression analysis to try to predict a salesperson’s total yearly sales (the dependent variable) from independent variables such as age, education and years of experience.<br>

      </p>
      <h3>Renewable energy</h3>
      <p>
      Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate
      than they are consumed. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us.<br>
      Renewable energy generation produces far fewer emissions than burning fossil fuels. A transition
      from fossil fuels, which currently account for the majority of emissions, to renewable energy is
      essential to address the climate change crisis.<br>

      <img src="imagenes/9.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />
    </p>

      <h4>In contrast</h4>
     <p>
        Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, are non-renewable energy sources that take hundreds of
        millions of years to form. Fossil fuels produce energy when they are burned, which causes harmful
        emissions in the form of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.<br>
